# ABSTRACT: Manage website javascript files with the Dancer2 configuration file

=head1 NAME

Dancer2::Plugin::JSManager - Manage website javascript files with the Dancer2 configuration file

=head1 OVERVIEW

This is a simple plugin for the L<Dancer2|http://perldancer.org/> web application framework. The target audience for this software is Dancer2 website developers looking for an easy way to insert javascript files into their templates using the Dancer2 configuration file. It can also make websites more reliable by falling back to local copies of javascript files hosted on a content delivery network (CDN) if the CDN goes down.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    In the Dancer2 configuration file, make an entry for each javascript file you are using on the site
    in the order you'd like them to appear in the web page like so:

    plugins:
    JSManager:
        ; 'autoload' defaults to 1 if not supplied. Setting to 0 turns off all javascript.  
        autoload: 1                                                

        ; create a variable called 'libraries'  
        libraries:

          ; A name you give to the library, must be preceded by a dash  
          - jquery:                                                

            ; The URL where the js file is hosted on the CDN       
            uri: 'https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.1.min.js'  

            ;Path to local js file in case CDN is unavailable     
            fallback: '/js/jquery-1.11.1.min.js'                 

            ; This library depends on the previous library so we put it second   
          - jqm:                                                   
            uri: 'http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.4.5/jquery.mobile-1.4.5.min.js'
            fallback: '/js/jquery.mobile-1.4.5.min.js'
          - growler:
            ; if a file is not on a CDN simply put the path to the local file   
            uri: '/js/jquery.growl.min.js'                       

            ; control where in the template the javascript will appear (see below for more explanation)  
            injection_pt: 'body_top'                            

    After modifying your config file, all you have to do is put a variable called C<js_head>
    in the C<head> portion of your tempalte. So, for example, if you are using L<Template::Toolkit>,
    you would add the following into the C<<head>> section: 
    
    [% js_head %]

    If you want to inject the javascript into different parts of your page, you can with a
    custom variable determined by the C<injection_pt> property, preceded by C<js_>. So, from the
    example above, the growler script has the C<injection_pt> set to C<body_top> so you would
    place the following in the appropriate place in your template:

    [% js_body_top %]

=head1 CONFIGURATION

Modify your L<Dancer2::Config> file and template files according to the examples above.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES

None reported.

=head1 MOTIVATION

I'm new to Dancer2 development and wrote this plugin to scratch a minor itch and to learn how to write a basic Dancer2 module.

=head1 DEVELOPMENT NOTES

This software is actively maintained. Further releases are expected to help exercise my budding software development skills. Feedback, suggestions, and contributions are greatly appreciated and welcome.

Eventually, I'd like to improve this module to automatically download external javascripts to the local machine and periodically download fresh copies (perhaps once a day) to ensure the local js copy is in sync with the CDN. Longer term, I'm interested in exploring the possibility of making an admin interface for updating the settings configration file. Another possible future feautre is the selection of a CDN for based on the name of some of the more the popular libraries. Finally, I'd like to expand this to be able to handle css files as well.
